Here you can find the graphs made by me for the data structures class, including both a graph with cost for the awns and a graph without cost for the awns


Remember to include the header file "graph.h" for you to use it in your code

for adding awns remember they are added unidirectionally, so if you want a non directed graph you must add the awn that connects A with B and also the one that connects B with A
