# Graphs for Data Structures Class

In this repository you'll find graphs created for the Data Structures class. These include both a cost-inclusive graph and a graph without cost for the given edge.

## Usage

To seamlessly integrate these graphs into your code, make sure to include the following header file:

```c
#include "graph.h"

```
## Adding an edge

Remember that the addawn() function adds an edge unidirectionally, so if you want to make a non directed graph you must add both, the edge that connects A with B and the one that connects B with A
